  Transforms an XML element into a JSON string representation.  See http://json.org.    Sample usage:  
        xquery version "1.0-ml";    import module namespace json="http://marklogic.com/json" at "json.xqy";    json:serialize(&lt;foo&gt;&lt;bar&gt;kid&lt;/bar&gt;&lt;/foo&gt;)    Sample transformations:    Namespace URIs are ignored.  Namespace prefixes are included in the JSON name.   Attributes are ignored, except for the special attribute 

="true" that  indicates the JSON serialization should write the node, even if single, as an  array, and the attribute  that can be set to "boolean" or "number" to  dictate the value should be written as that type (unquoted).  There's also  an  attribute that when set to true writes the inner content as text  rather than as structured JSON, useful for sending some XHTML over the  wire.   Text nodes within mixed content are ignored.
